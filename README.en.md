## Preamble

Hello! This repository documents my personal learning path.

I’m an ordinary CS undergraduate. Many people aren’t lacking motivation—they just aren’t sure **how** to make progress. Some even start with a blank slate: “Is computer science just about calculators?” You want to begin, then realize you don’t know **what** to learn.

This repository is both a snapshot of my own journey and a reference for classmates who, like me, **want to improve but often feel lost**. I hope it helps build **metacognition**—knowing what to learn, how to learn, and why.

> Computer science never lacks geniuses—their ideas shaped today’s Internet industry. That inspires my curiosity. Around us, we also see “fast-track” stories—“master Java in 3 months,” “land a big-offer in 6 months.” Impressive, but often superhuman and hard to follow.

I want this repo to be a grounded record of growth. With clear planning, steady effort, and the right methods, even ordinary students can walk a solid path.

- **A modest goal:** write helpful content that people can casually browse after dinner—ideally learning something right away. If it sparks curiosity and helps you discover new areas, this repo is happy to be your **springboard**.

## Repository Navigation

This repository currently has four main modules, covering the path from project management and frameworks to CS fundamentals.

---

### [01-Project-Management](./01-Project-Management)
**Project management & engineering practices**

Code is only part of a project’s success. Here I record what I learned while running a “college innovation & entrepreneurship” project from 0 to 1.

* **Scrum & Agile**: how our team iterated with agile practices.
* **Docs & Typesetting (`Docx-Typeset`)**: clear technical writing and clean Word layouts.
* **Tools**: notes on `Draw.io` (flowcharts), `Mermaid` (diagrams-as-code), etc.

---

### [02-Frameworks-Libraries](./02-Frameworks-Libraries)
**Backend tech stack in practice**

As a Java learner, this is where I accumulate notes and code around mainstream backend tech, aiming for a solid, modern stack.

* **Core frameworks**: the Spring family (Spring Boot, Spring MVC, …).
* **Infrastructure**: `Maven` (build), `Docker` (containerization), `Redis` (caching), and more.

---

### [03-CS-foundation](./03-CS-foundation)
**Core CS fundamentals**

This lays the theoretical groundwork for my career and potential graduate studies (CN-OS-CA-DSA + DB).

**Highlight**: curated **introductory exercises** to consolidate fundamentals. The difficulty grows more gently than typical LeetCode tracks—meant to help you ramp up painlessly and build positive feedback.

* **Computer Networks**
* **Operating Systems**
* **Computer Organization** 
* **Data Structures & Algorithms** (C/C++/Java)
* **Databases**: from simple SQL questions to design/normalization thinking

---

### [04-OS-Implementation](./04-OS-Implementation) *(planned)*
**Build a small operating system by hand**

Theory should return to practice. I’ll document building a tiny OS to turn knowledge into working code—**knowing by doing**. I’ll start with **x86_64 assembly** and **C**.

## About Me

* **Who am I?** 2024 intake, Chengdu University of Information Technology — Computer Science (Blockchain Engineering).  
  Name: **Liu Hangyu**, Student ID: **2024131035**
* **Goals**: First, become a **backend engineer** with strong application-layer fundamentals; later, dive deeper to grow into an **architect**.
* **Feedback**: If this project helps you, a **Star** is appreciated ⭐. Suggestions and questions are welcome in **Issues**!
