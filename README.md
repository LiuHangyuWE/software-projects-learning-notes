# DataStructure

#### Introduction
It is my coding experiment which reports my grow-up experience.

### Prime Language Used Here
1. In the term of learning data structure, predominantly I used C and Cpp when necessarily.
2. After finishing my Freshman life, I began to use Java to be my working language. Using it do Leetcode titles and be my prime language.
